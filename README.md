# Skelington
A repository for project templates that wrap different game development frameworks. These will be revisited and updated as they are used for jams. 

# High-Level Goals
The overarching goals for all templates is to provide:

- Simple content management and easy prototyping for team members not participating in code development
- Boilerplate code that covers generalized jam/prototype needs

# Development Goals
Development priorities for each of the wrappers will be as follows:

- Data-driven elements to decouple code and content
- Generalized state systems to cover the most common use cases (e.g., start-game-gameover)
- Common starting points for a variety of game types
- Common interfaces to a variety of HIDs

# Roadmap
Current target languages and frameworks are as follows:

- Javascript using Phaser (https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser)
- C++ using SFML (https://github.com/SFML/SFML)
